# CO₂ Emissions Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive analysis examines CO₂ emissions data from 1949-2023 across global continents and countries. Using advanced data manipulation techniques in Python and SQL, we provide key insights into emission patterns, growth trends, and regional disparities through statistical analysis and compelling visualizations.

## Key Findings

### Global Emission Patterns
- **Europe** and **Asia** dominate global emissions, accounting for the largest shares
- **Oceania** shows the lowest total emissions across all continents
- Global emissions have grown substantially since 1949, with significant regional variations

### Top Emitters by Region
- **OECD countries** consistently rank among top emitters across multiple continents
- **China** and **United States** emerge as major global contributors
- Regional leadership patterns vary significantly by continent

### Growth Trends
- Average global growth rate: **1.29%** annually (filtered data)
- Median growth rate: **0.00%**, indicating balanced growth/decline patterns
- Significant volatility in year-over-year changes across countries
